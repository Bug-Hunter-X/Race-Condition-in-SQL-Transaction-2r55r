This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in an SQL transaction.  Two concurrent transactions attempting to update account balances can lead to an inaccurate final balance. The `bug.sql` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.sql` provides a solution using proper locking mechanisms to prevent this issue.  The issue is explained in more detail in the bug description.
